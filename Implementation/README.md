# Implementation
To test the LeadFL defense, we modified the client implementation to match the paper more closely.


# Quick-Start
- Initiate the submodule and replace the client:
    `./init.sh`
- Follow the guidance from the LeadFL [documentation](LeadFL/README.md)
- To swap between implementations, use:
   - For the original implementation: `./swap.sh original` 
   - For the original implementation: `./swap.sh modified`
